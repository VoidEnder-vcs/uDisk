# uDisk
uDisk is a small single-file command-line utility built in C++. Currently it runs on Windows 64-bit and 32-bit. uDisk requires currently no runtime dependencies, and uses single-character commands.
*To run, download udisk.exe (udisk32.exe for 32-bit Windows) and just run it. It should launch a Command Prompt window with uDisk.*
